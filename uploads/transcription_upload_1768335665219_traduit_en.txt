To all French people, France lost a battle, but France did not lose the war. Meeting governments have been able to capitulate, giving in to panic, forgetting honor, delivering the country to servitude. However, nothing is lost, nothing is lost because this war is a world war. In the free universe, immense forces have not yet given. One day, these forces will crush the enemy, France must be present for victory that day. Then she will regain her freedom and her greatness, that is my goal, my only goal. This is why I invite all French people wherever they are to unite with me in action, in sacrifice and in hope. Our homeland is in mortal danger, let us all fight to save it, long live France.
